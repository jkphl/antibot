## Documentation

Please find the [project documentation](doc/index.md) in the `doc` directory.

## Installation

This library requires PHP >=7.2 or later. I recommend using the latest available version of PHP as a matter of principle. It has no userland dependencies.

## Dependencies

![Composer dependency graph](https://rawgit.com/jkphl/antibot/master/doc/dependencies.svg)

## Quality

To run the unit tests at the command line, issue `composer install` and then `phpunit` at the package root. This requires [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to be available as `composer`, and [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/manual/) to be available as `phpunit`.

This library attempts to comply with [PSR-1][], [PSR-2][], and [PSR-4][]. If you notice compliance oversights, please send a patch via pull request.
